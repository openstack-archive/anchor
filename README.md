Anchor
============

Anchor is an ephemeral PKI service that, based on certain conditions,
automates the verification of CSRs and signs certificates for clients.
The validity period can be set in the config file with hour resolution.

Ideas behind Anchor
===================

A critical capability within PKI is to revoke a certificate - to ensure that it
is no longer trusted by any peer. Unfortunately research has demonstrated that
the two typical methods of revocation (Certificate Revocation Lists and Online
Certificate Status Protocol) both have failings that make them unreliable,
especially when attempting to leverage PKI outside of web-browser software.

Through the use of short-lifetime certificates Anchor introduces the concept of
"passive revocation". By issuing certificates with lifetimes measured in hours,
revocation can be achieved by simply not re-issuing certificates to clients.

The benefits of using Anchor instead of manual long-term certificates are:

* quick certificate revoking / rotation
* always tested certificate update mechanism (used daily)
* easy integration with certmonger for service restarting
* certificates are signed only when validation is passed
* signing certificates follows consistent process

Installation
============

In order to install Anchor from source, the following system dependencies need
to be present:

* python 2.7
* python (dev files)
* libffi (dev)
* libssl (dev)

When everything is in place, Anchor can be installed in one of three ways. For
development, run:

    virtualenv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    python setup.py develop

For installing into virtualenv, run:

    virtualenv path/to/environment
    . path/to/environment/bin/activate
    python setup.py install

For installing in production, either install a perpared system package, or
install globally in the system:

    python setup.py install

Running the service
===================

In order to run the service, it needs to be started via the `pecan` application
server. The only extra parameter is a config file:

    pecan serve config.py

For development, an additional `--reload` parameter may be used. It will cause
the service to reload every time a source file is changed, however it requires
installing an additional `watchdog` python module.

In the default configuration, Anchor will wait for web requests on port 5000 on
local network interface. This can be adjusted in the `config.py` file.

Preparing a test environment
============================

In order to test Anchor with the default configuration, the following can be
done to create a test CA. The test certificate can be then used to sign the new
certificates.

    openssl req -out CA/root-ca.crt -keyout CA/root-ca-unwrapped.key \
        -newkey rsa:4096 -subj "/CN=Anchor Test CA" -nodes -x509 -days 365
    chmod 0400 CA/root-ca-unwrapped.key

Next, a new certificate request may be generated:

    openssl req -out anchor-test.example.com.csr -nodes \
        -keyout anchor-test.example.com.key -newkey rsa:2048 \
        -subj "/CN=anchor-test.example.com"

That reqest can be submitted using curl (while `pecan serve config.py` is
running):

    curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/sign -F user='myusername' \
        -F secret='simplepassword' -F encoding=pem \
        -F 'csr=<anchor-test.example.com.csr'

This will result in the signed request being created in the `certs` directory.

Running Anchor in production
============================

Anchor shouldn't be exposed directly to the network. It's running via an
application server (Pecan) and doesn't have all the features you'd normally
expect from a http proxy - for example dealing well with deliberately slow
connections, or using multiple workers. Anchor can however be run in production
using a better frontend.

To run Anchor using uwsgi you can use the following command:

    uwsgi --http-socket :5000 --venv path/to/venv --pecan config.py -p 4

In case a more complex scripted configuration is needed, for example to handle
custom headers, rate limiting, or source filtering a complete HTTP proxy like
Nginx may be needed. This is however out of scope for Anchor project. You can
read more about production deployment in
[Pecan documentation](http://pecan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/deployment.html).

Additionally, using an AppArmor profile for Anchor is a good idea to prevent
exploits relying on one of the native libraries used by Anchor (for example
OpenSSL). This can be done with sample profiles which you can find in the
`tools/apparmor.anchor_*` files. The used file needs to be reviewed and updated
with the right paths depending on the deployment location.

Validators
==========

One of the main features of Anchor are the validators which make sure that all
requests match a given set of rules. They're configured in `config.json` and
the sample configuration includes a few of them.

Each validator takes a dictionary of options which provide the specific
matching conditions.

Currenly available validators are:

* `common_name` ensures CN matches one of names in `allowed_domains` or ranges
  in `allowed_networks`

* `alternative_names` ensures alternative names match one of the names in
  `allowed_domains`

* `alternative_names_ip` ensures alternative names match one of the names in
  `allowed_domains` or IP ranges in `allowed_networks`

* `blacklist_names` ensures CN and alternative names do not contain any of the
  configured `domains`

* `server_group` ensures the group the requester is contained within
  `group_prefixes`

* `extensions` ensures only `allowed_extensions` are present in the request

* `key_usage` ensures only `allowed_usage` is requested for the certificate

* `ca_status` ensures the request does/doesn't require the CA flag

* `source_cidrs` ensures the request comes from one of the ranges in `cidrs`

A configuration entry for a validator might look like one from the sample
config:

    "key_usage": {
      "allowed_usage": [
        "Digital Signature",
        "Key Encipherment",
        "Non Repudiation"
      ]
    }

Authentication
==============

Anchor can use one of the following authentication modules: static, keystone,
ldap.

Static: Username and password are present in `config.json`. This mode should be
used only for development and testing.

  "auth": {
    "static": {
      "secret": "simplepassword",
      "user": "myusername"
    }
  }

Keystone: Username is ignored, but password is a token valid in the configured
keystone location.

  "auth": {
    "keystone": {
      "url": "https://keystone.example.com"
    }
  }

LDAP: Username and password are used to bind to an LDAP user in a configured
domain. User's groups for the `server_group` filter are retrieved from
attribute `memberOf` in search for `(sAMAccountName=username@domain)`. The
search is done in the configured base.

    "auth": {
      "ldap": {
        "host": "ldap.example.com",
        "base": "ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com",
        "domain": "example.com"
        "port": 636,
        "ssl": true
      }
    }

Signing backends
================

Anchor allows the use of configurable signing backend. While it provides one
implementation (based on cryptography.io and OpenSSL), other implementations
may be configured.

The resulting certificate is stored locally if the `output_path` is set to any
string. This does not depend on the configured backend.

Backends can specify their own options - please refer to the backend
documentation for the specific list. The default backend takes the following
options:

* `cert_path`: path where local CA certificate can be found

* `key_path`: path to the key for that certificate

* `signing_hash`: which hash method to use when producing signatures

* `valid_hours`: number of hours the signed certificates are valid for

Sample configuration for the default backend:

    "ca": {
      "cert_path": "CA/root-ca.crt",
      "key_path": "CA/root-ca-unwrapped.key",
      "output_path": "certs",
      "signing_hash": "sha256",
      "valid_hours": 24
    }
