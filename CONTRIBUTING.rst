This project is part of the OpenStack / Stackforge family. If you would like to
contribute to the development, you must follow the steps in this page:

    http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack should be submitted
for review via the Gerrit tool, following the workflow documented at:

    http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

(in short - install git-review package, then submit changes via `git review`)

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:
