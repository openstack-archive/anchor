Files in "anchor/asn1" have been generated from the asn1 modules in "asn"
directory using asn1ate (https://github.com/kimgr/asn1ate/)

They can be regenerated by:
- running asn1ate on each module
- putting .i and .e results together (implicit / explicit modules)
- removing faked imports
- linking missing classes to other rfcXXXX files

There's currently no fully automatic way to do it.
